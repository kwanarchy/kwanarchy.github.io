<p>Anarchism, despite initial reactions, is not the political philosophy of throwing bombs, setting things on fire, or destroying property without reason. Instead, anarchy is the philosophy that all unjust hierarchies must be abolished in favour of a linear, equal society in which no person is above another. Subsequently, anarchists work towards a completely voluntary society in which everyones thoughts within the community are accounted for, as well as no person holding any meaningful power over another.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent examples of unjust power over others can be seen in the workplace, and eliminating this power dynamic is one of anarchy’s key objectives. What we are referring to is the worker-employer dynamic. The worker needs their employer, but the employer does not need the individual worker. In our current society, there is a primal, unbreakable rule - work or starve. Because of this, the worker’s employer holds a significant amount of leverage over the worker. One could argue that the worker could simply leave in order to find a better work place, however this is of no detriment to the employer as another worker will come just as easily, and the worker who left will be discouraged to take such a risk as they may be unable to find a new job. Consequently, the worker will be more lenient in how the employer treats them. Their work and labour is sold off and given to the employer in return for a measly wage; if a product is sold for $100 and a worker is paid $1 to produce it, then the employer takes $99. How can this be considered fair in a truly equal society? In conjunction with this, those who hoarde the wealth purposefully choke products’ output as to control the prices; <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/food-loss-and-waste">In the U.S. alone, 30-40% of the food goes to waste and is thrown away as it would not be profitable to sell it.</a> Under the current system, human labor and energy is wasted in the name of maximizing profits. Vast legions of the working class are willing to put in their labour in order to better society yet have it denied in order to keep prices high and wages low.</p>
